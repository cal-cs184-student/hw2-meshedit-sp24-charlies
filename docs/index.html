<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Bezier Curves with 1D de Casteljau Subdivision</h3>


<b>
  Briefly explain de Casteljau's algorithm and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier curves.
</b>
<p>
    De Casteljau's algorithm is a way of evaluating Bezuer curves by linearly interpolating from a set of points in 2D space. Given n points, we recursively evalutate subdivision levels (each of which produce n - 1 points), until we get a single point. Parametrized with t (which is defined between 0 and 1), we are able to define the Bezier curve itself. Our implementation implements a single evaluation step that reduces a list of n points to n - 1 points, which are them recursively called in the main function. Given a value for t, we evalutated the points such that the ith point in the subsequent list of points is equal to t * points[i] + (1 - t) points[i + 1] if points is the list of points given as an input.

<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Bezier Surfaces with Separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how de Casteljau algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier surfaces.
</b>
<p>
    We used a very similar algorithm to generate our Bezier surfaces. This was very similar to de Casteljau algorithm since we are still working with a list of points, but the difference is that it is a n x n grid of points rather than just a list of n points. We are able to essentially use de Casteljau's algorithm for each of the n list to retrieve a list of n points for some parameter u. With the new list of points, we can run through the algorithm again parametrized on v to get a single point on our Bezier surface. The algorithm parametrized on u and v then defines the surface. We evaluated a single step (similar to how we did it in part 1) in our evaluateStep function. We recursively applied that step to generate a single point in evaluate1D. We then combined everything together in the final evaluate function, which first used evaluate1D to reduce the n x n grid into a list of n points, then used it again to retrieve a single point.

<h3 align="middle">Part 3: Area-Weighted Vertex Normals</h3>

<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the area-weighted vertex normals.

<p>
    I implemented area weighted vertex normals by summing together the area weighted normal vectors to each face, then taking the result as a unit vector. This was done
