<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>
    In this hw, we implemented Bezier curves and surfaces, a method for shading using normal vectors, and a system of transforms on meshes to allow for subdivision on triangle meshes. These techniques allow us to better understand how meshes are constructed and rendered and how surfaces can be modeled generally, as well as how to interact with the half-edge data structure.

<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Bezier Curves with 1D de Casteljau Subdivision</h3>


<b>
  Briefly explain de Casteljau's algorithm and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier curves.
</b>
<p>
    De Casteljau's algorithm is a way of evaluating Bezuer curves by linearly interpolating from a set of points in 2D space. Given n points, we recursively evalutate subdivision levels (each of which produce n - 1 points), until we get a single point. Parametrized with t (which is defined between 0 and 1), we are able to define the Bezier curve itself. Our implementation implements a single evaluation step that reduces a list of n points to n - 1 points, which are them recursively called in the main function. Given a value for t, we evalutated the points such that the ith point in the subsequent list of points is equal to t * points[i] + (1 - t) points[i + 1] if points is the list of points given as an input.

<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Bezier Surfaces with Separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how de Casteljau algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier surfaces.
</b>
<p>
    We used a very similar algorithm to generate our Bezier surfaces. This was very similar to de Casteljau algorithm since we are still working with a list of points, but the difference is that it is a n x n grid of points rather than just a list of n points. We are able to essentially use de Casteljau's algorithm for each of the n list to retrieve a list of n points for some parameter u. With the new list of points, we can run through the algorithm again parametrized on v to get a single point on our Bezier surface. The algorithm parametrized on u and v then defines the surface. We evaluated a single step (similar to how we did it in part 1) in our evaluateStep function. We recursively applied that step to generate a single point in evaluate1D. We then combined everything together in the final evaluate function, which first used evaluate1D to reduce the n x n grid into a list of n points, then used it again to retrieve a single point.

<h3 align="middle">Part 3: Area-Weighted Vertex Normals</h3>

<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the area-weighted vertex normals.
</b>
<p>
    I implemented area weighted vertex normals by summing together the area weighted normal vectors to each face, then taking the result as a unit vector. This was done by first starting with the halfedge from the vertex object. This would allow us to iterate through each of the halfedges defining the face as well as retrieving the vertices for that face. Using the 3 vertices, we are able to compute 2 vectors that define the surface of the face and compute the unit normal vector (cross project of two vectors divided by norm) and the area (half of the magnitude of the cross product), which we multiplied together to form the area weight normal for one of the faces. We then moved onto the next halfedge from the original vertex, which we got by taking the twin of the original halfedge then iterating to the next halfedge. This process would continue until we reached our original half edge. We kept a running sum of each area weighted normal, which we normalized to get our final vector that we would use for shading.

    I followed the advice to specify all of the attributes of mesh elements regardless of if they're changed. I made a diagram of the before and after of the edge flip. Besides that, I just did basic pointer manipulation, and manipulated it such that the edge was connecting the other vertices.

<b>

<p>
    I followed the procedure above of drawing a diagram and to potentially do redundant assignments to ensure correctness. I first implemented it such that I discarded the original edge and half-edges, but ran into problems in the next part. Thus, I changed my diagram to keep the initial edge.

<h3 align="middle">Part 6: Loop Subdivision for Mesh Upsampling</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the loop subdivision and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
    I followed the outline provided in the comments and described in the part. First, I calculated the new positions of new vertices and old vertices according to the formula, split all edges, and then flipped edges that connected old vertices to new. Finally, I updated the positions of old vertices. One trick I used was that to find a segfault I had, I commented out code selectively and figured out it was a problem with my for loop, and then subsequently a problem with my implementation of edge splits. I also had a problem with calculating the sum of the neighbors because I thought it was already done with computeCentroid, and printed out the centroid to see it was uninitialized.
</p>

      </td>
    </tr>
    <br>
  </table>
</div>
As you do loop subdivision, sharp edges are reduced and turned smoother, and there is less jaggedness in the overall shape (or at the very least it looks smoother).  

<div align="middle">
  <table style="width:100%">
    <tr align="center">
      <td>
        <img src="images/iter4.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
        <figcaption>Regular subdivision</figcaption>

        <figcaption>Split subdivision</figcaption>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <br>
  </table>
</div>
<br>
<p>
In this case, I lessened the effect of smoothing by creating a bunch of edges leading to the same vertex by splitting. Then, as they are repeatedly smoothed, there is still the outline of the redundant lines.

  Load dae/cube.dae. Perform several iterations of loop subdivision on the cube. Notice that the cube becomes slightly asymmetric after repeated subdivisions. Can you pre-process the cube with edge flips and splits so that the cube subdivides symmetrically? Document these effects and explain why they occur. Also explain how your pre-processing helps alleviate the effects.
</b>
<p>
    I preprocessed the edges with edge splits (1 on the middle on each side) in order to ensure that the edges at the start are symmetric. This matters as loop subdivision depends upon the starting mesh and what edges and vertices exist at the start. Since the mesh is asymmetric at the start, even though it is correctly in the shape of a cube, the inferred shape as you continue to loop subdivide is asymmetric. This makes sense as the created vertexes and edges will be weighed based upon the neighbors, and the neighbors tend to be concentrated in a specific direction which will influence the inferred shape. By evening out the asymmetry at the start, this no longer occurs. The figure below demonstrates the symmetric cube.
